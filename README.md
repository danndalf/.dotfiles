dot dot files
=============

Dann's dotfiles.  Make yourself at home.

Installation
------------

First, clone the repo to the new home folder

	$ git clone https://danndalf@github.com/danndalf/.dotfiles.git

Next, link the freshly cloned dotlings into their new homes

	$ ./.dotfiles/install

This will go through and backup any existing dotfiles into `~/.dotfiles/backups`.

Maintenance
-----------

To update dotfiles, git pull and re-run `./.dotfiles/install` again.  That's it.

Documentation
-------------

Utility documentation is available in rdoc, autogenerated from source comments.  To generate this documentation, run:

	$ rdoc install uninstall bin/* -N

This will create a `doc` folder with all the relevant documentation.

Uninstallation
--------------

Do the above in reverse:

	$ ./.dotfiles/uninstall

This will tell you if it had trouble restoring any backed up files.  You may need to handle some of those manualy.

	$ rm -rf ~/.dotfiles

Have fun!
